# Auto-Tweet-Unliker
This is a code that will automatically unlike your tweets on twitter or X . Inspired by -> 
https://gist.github.com/aymericbeaumet/d1d6799a1b765c3c8bc0b675b1a1547d

Just copy the code and paste it in your console of the browser in your twitter like tab.
If it stops because there are too many requests, refresh and wait for a few hours and try again.
You can change the amount of tweets you want to unlike by changing the target count variable at 
the start of the code.
By default it is set to 100.
